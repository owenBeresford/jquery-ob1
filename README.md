# jquery-ob1
Plugin for some of my site features. **Very little reusability**  I normally name very specific company behaviour code after the company that owns it, so in this case it needs to be named after me... >.<  This scales better than calling 50% of files 'app.js'

This code drives features in owenberesford.me.uk This little project tidies up the namespace abit, and drops hacks required from 2010.
I need to put some glue code and build scripting somewhere, it will probably be dumped into this project as well.
