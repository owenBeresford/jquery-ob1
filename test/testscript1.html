I can't make a standalone script for this module, without much effort.
This plugin is wrapper code/ config injection (client side JS has few  configs), and uses
 *  jQuery must already be loaded 
 *  uses jquery-readDuration when installed
 *  uses jquery-columniser when installed
 *  uses jquery-resize when installed
 *  uses jquery-biblio when installed
Without the workers, it just does less 

I am the only likely user, and I manually tested it on my test copy of my site, when I wrote it.
This plugin has too many dependencies to make a good unit test.
